            React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
            It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
             React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.</p>

                We have to import components from libraries and use them in the App class or any other class.

                Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
   
                 Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
           
             </p>

                React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.

                JSX is optional and not required to use React.
